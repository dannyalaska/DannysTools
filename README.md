A Copy / Paste Toolset

I created this Tkinter GUI to automate a lot of the repetitive tasks that I found myself doing over and over again. 
Each button accomplishes a different task.
* Copy From / Zip :: Takes contents of clipboard (which should be a filename) and prints out commands to securely copy a file from a remote server through a jump server
* Copy To :: Takes contents of clipboard and prints commands to send files to remote server through jump server
* Cleanup Markup :: Takes clipboard contents (MySQL results printout) and creates JIRA-friendly markup for code and tables
* Make List: No Quotes :: Takes vertical/column list (like excel or column-selected items) and converts it to comma-separated list
* Make List: Quotes :: Takes vertical/column list and converts it to comma-separated list with quotes wrapping each item.
